### Round 1 Analysis

- Generator was CPU-bound on D8s_v3 (64x load on 8 cores)
- F16s_v2 → F32s_v2 gave only +5% kraken combined — CDN was the ceiling
- D16s_v3 ≈ F16s_v2 (same Xeon 8272CL in eastus2 region)
- F32s_v2 T1 static actually dropped 10% from thread-to-NIC-queue contention

## Round 2: Keepalive-Optimized (CDN team recommendation)

CDN team identified that 65-72% of CDN CPU was spent on TCP connection setup/teardown.
Redesigned benchmark: fewer persistent connections, explicit keepalive, no curl loops.

### Test A: F16s_v2 Keepalive (16 vCPU, 32 GiB)

Kernel tuning: somaxconn=131072, tw_buckets=4M, file-max=4M
RPS/RFS: mask=ffff on eth0 (16 queues), ring buf rx=18139 tx=2560, THP=always
Test params: wrk 16t/256c/ep, hey 192c/ep, ~3,072 total persistent connections

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| T1 wrk static (7 ep) | 205,169 req/s (avg lat 8.9ms) |
| T2 wrk Lua randomized | 36,576 req/s (avg lat 575ms) |
| T3 hey goroutine (4 ep) | 123,497 req/s (avg lat 17ms) |
| T5 kraken combined | 156,659 req/s |
| Peak CPU | 61.38 (3.8x oversubscribed) |
| Peak RAM | 1,134 MB / 32 GiB (3.5%) |
| TIME_WAIT post-T1 | 345 (95% reduction from non-keepalive) |

### Test B: F32s_v2 Keepalive (32 vCPU, 64 GiB, Xeon 8370C @ 2.80 GHz)

Kernel tuning: somaxconn=131072, tw_buckets=8M, file-max=8M
RPS/RFS: mask=ffffffff on eth0 (16 queues), ring buf rx=18139 tx=2560, THP=always
Test params: wrk 32t/512c/ep, hey 384c/ep, ~5,920 total persistent connections

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| T1 wrk static (7 ep) | 208,884 req/s (avg lat 17.5ms) |
| T2 wrk Lua randomized | 53,537 req/s (avg lat 638ms) |
| T3 hey goroutine (4 ep) | 167,745 req/s (avg lat 34ms) |
| T5 kraken combined | 131,606 req/s |
| Peak CPU | 18.57 (0.6x — barely loaded) |
| Peak RAM | 1,453 MB / 64 GiB (2%) |
| TIME_WAIT post-T1 | 122 |

### Round 2 Analysis

- **Keepalive was the real win**: hey went from 52K to 123K (+135%) on F16s_v2
- **CDN was the ceiling**: F32s_v2 at 18.57 CPU (0.6x) couldn't push more than F16s_v2
- **Kraken combined went DOWN on F32s_v2** (131K vs 156K) — more connections meant more CDN overhead for diminishing returns
- **F16s_v2 declared winner** at half the cost of F32s_v2

### Key finding

The CDN simulator on F16s_v2 maxed out at ~29K req/s per endpoint regardless of generator size. This was the server-side ceiling. Upgrading CDN to F32s_v2 should raise this ceiling significantly.

## Pending: Round 3 — CDN on F32s_v2

CDN team deploying F32s_v2 (32 vCPU). Expected to raise the per-endpoint ceiling.
Will re-run F16s_v2 vs F32s_v2 generator comparison against the larger CDN.
If CDN ceiling doubles, the F32s_v2 generator may now show proportional gains.
