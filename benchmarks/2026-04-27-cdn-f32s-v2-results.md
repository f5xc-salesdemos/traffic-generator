## Analysis

### Why F32s_v2 wins individual tests but loses combined kraken

1. **Connection count is the key variable.** F32s_v2 opens ~5,920 persistent connections (scaled to 32 cores) vs F16s_v2's ~3,072. When running individually, the CDN handles this fine. When ALL tools run simultaneously, 5,920 connections competing for CDN resources creates more overhead per connection.

2. **The CDN has a connection-serving ceiling.** At ~50K req/s per endpoint for static wrk, both generators hit the same CDN ceiling. Adding more connections doesn't raise that ceiling — it just spreads CDN CPU across more connection state management.

3. **F16s_v2 gets more req/connection.** With 3,072 connections pushing 224K req/s = ~73 req/s per connection. F32s_v2 with 5,920 connections pushing 152K req/s = ~26 req/s per connection. The CDN is more efficient serving fewer, busier connections.

4. **F32s_v2's CPU headroom is wasted.** At 47.24 peak CPU on 32 cores, the generator has massive unused capacity. But throwing more connections at the CDN doesn't help — it hurts.

### The optimization gap

F32s_v2 should be run with F16s_v2's connection count (3,072) but 32 wrk threads. This would give double the request generation CPU per connection without adding CDN connection overhead. The current benchmark scales connections linearly with cores — which is wrong for keepalive workloads.

## Comparison Across CDN Sizes

| Generator → CDN | T1 wrk static | T3 hey | T5 kraken | Generator CPU |
|-----------------|---------------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| F16 → CDN F16 | 205,169 | 123,497 | 156,659 | 61.38 |
| F32 → CDN F16 | 208,884 | 167,745 | 131,606 | 18.57 |
| **F16 → CDN F32** | **350,718** | **158,378** | **224,646** | **84.90** |
| F32 → CDN F32 | 330,266 | 233,037 | 152,404 | 47.24 |

### Key takeaway

The single biggest throughput improvement came from **upgrading the CDN** (F16→F32), not the generator. F16 generator against CDN F32 produced 224K kraken — the highest combined throughput across all tests. The generator was CPU-saturated (84.90) but the CDN had enough capacity to serve every request efficiently with only 3,072 connections.

---

## Recommendation

**For maximum combined throughput: F16s_v2 generator + F32s_v2 CDN.**

The F16s_v2 generator at ~$0.677/hr delivers the highest kraken combined (224K) because it opens the right number of connections for the CDN to serve efficiently. F32s_v2 generator at ~$1.353/hr opens too many connections and gets 32% less combined throughput.

**However**, if the workload is single-tool (not combined kraken), F32s_v2 generator delivers +47-49% more on hey/Lua tests. For specialized load testing rather than combined stress testing, F32s_v2 has merit.

**Next optimization**: Run F32s_v2 generator with connection counts capped at F16s_v2 levels (3,072 total) to isolate whether the issue is connection count or something else.
